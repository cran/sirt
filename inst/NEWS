NOTE  * restructured rasch.testlet.glmer function
DATA  * included data set reading data.read
NOTE  * set a different default in rasch.mml (estimation of trait SD seemed incorrect)
NOTE  * rasch.testlet.glmer: output EAPs and EAP reliability
NOTE  * included loglog and cloglog link functions in rasch.testlet.glmer
ADDED * included jackknife estimation of the joint maximum likelihood
        Rasch model
NOTE  * included a speeded version of rasch.copula and labelled it 
        as rasch.copula2 -> The old version rasch.copula remains in the package.
NOTE  * output posterior distribition, EAP estimates and
        EAP reliability in rasch.copula    
ADDED * introduced probit and logit version of rasch.pml: pairwise marginal 
        likelihood estimation
FIXED * removed some bugs (or inefficiencies) in numerical differentiation 
        in rasch.mml and rasch.copula
NOTE  * renamed sim.rasch.copula into sim.rasch.dep
ADDED * included function rasch.pairwise.itemcluster for the conditional 
        pairwise estimation method for locally dependent items   
NOTE  * package structure of sirtr is created
ADDED * included simulation function for Rasch copula model ('sim.rasch.copula')
